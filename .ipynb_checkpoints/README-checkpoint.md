# Credit-Card-Churn

## Modeling Objective

The goal of this analysis is to predict customer attrition (churn) for a
consumer credit card bank using customer demographic, account, and
transaction-level features.

This is framed as a binary classification problem, with an emphasis on
interpretability and proper validation using logistic regression.
